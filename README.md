Node web application that pulls Weather information for passed locations.

In order to get the API calls to work you need to sign-up and get:

1) <ACCES_KEY> from weatherstack.com:
- Place the <ACCES_KEY> in forecast.js where the const url is defined
- forecast.js is under src/utils folder

2) <ACCES_TOKEN> from mapbox.com:
- Place the <ACCES_TOKEN> in geocode.js where the const url is defined
- geocode.js is under src/utils folder

To see a working version check out my deployed app using Heroku:
